i think i focused a lot of my time on figuring out how to get 3d models from
other applications (such as MAYA) and I wanted to at least bring some of that
into the final project. we're kind of just with this guy, who isn't happy, isn't sad
just kind of surrounded by the sounds around him with absolutely no control over
what's happening. he know's he's just a part of it. other than that, there's a very
simple beat tracker that measures beats by average energy over time.

honestly, i wish i had a ton more time. i found opengl difficult to work with,
but rewarding when i started to get the hang out. there were a few things i
would have liked to implement but just didn't have the time.
